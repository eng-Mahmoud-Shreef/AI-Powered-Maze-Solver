# AI-Powered Maze Solver

**AI-Powered Maze Solver** is a lightweight and intuitive tool for designing and solving grid-based mazes. The project uses specific markers to define the starting point, goal, walls, and empty spaces, enabling users to simulate or visualize pathfinding and navigation tasks.

## Features
- **Simple Markup**: Use predefined symbols (`S`, `G`, `E`, `X`) to create and describe a maze.
- **Customizable Mazes**: Design unique grids with flexible layouts.
- **Pathfinding Applications**: Ideal for visualizing routes, exploring algorithms, or creating grid-based puzzles.

## Maze Key
- `S`: **Start point**
- `G`: **Goal point**
- `E`: **Empty space** (traversable)
- `X`: **Wall** (non-traversable)

## Example Maze
```plaintext
XXXXXXXXXXXXXGX
XEEEEEEEEEEEEEX
XXXEXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXEXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXEXEEEEEEEEEX
XXXEXXXXXEXXXXX
XXXEXXXXXEXXXXX
XXXEXXXXXEXXXXX
XXXEXXXXXEXXXXX
XXXEXXXXXEXXXXX
XXXEEEEEEEXXXXX
XXXEXXXXXEXXXXX
XXXEXXXXXEXXXXX
XXXEXXXXXEXXXXX
XXXSXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Powered-Maze-Solver.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Powered-Maze-Solver
   ```

## Usage
1. Customize the maze in the `map.txt` file.
2. Follow the instructions in `instructions.txt` for maze logic and solving.

## Future Plans
- Add visualization tools for better maze rendering.
- Implement pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A*).
- Add a web-based interface for easier interaction.
- Integrate AI to dynamically solve the maze and suggest optimal paths.
